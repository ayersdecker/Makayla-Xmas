# A Christmas Pause — Puzzle

This is a small static Christmas puzzle site. The poem lines are hidden behind ornaments — reveal them by clicking. Once all lines are revealed, use the first letters of each line to form the passphrase and enter it to unlock the celebration.

Passphrase (answer): the first letters of the five lines (case-insensitive).

Quick preview:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click the ornaments to reveal each line.
3. When all are revealed, enter the passphrase and press Submit.

Attach/Open feature:

- After entering the correct passphrase, two new buttons appear in the celebration view: `Attach to page` and `Open in new tab`.
- `Open in new tab` opens a user-provided URL in a new browser tab.
- `Open in new tab` opens a user-provided URL in a new browser tab.
- `Attach to page` now navigates the current tab to a local `next.html` page (so the flow continues in the same tab). If you prefer embedding or opening external URLs, use the overlay or `Open in new tab`.

Security note: The overlay uses an iframe with limited sandboxing; avoid embedding untrusted sites.

Files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — puzzle logic and animation
